# Scoring-protein-ligand-interactions
This uses the Open Drug Discovery Toolkit to score and encode protein-ligand interactions and encodes it and we get an IFCPS score using the cosine similarity as explained in this paper:Pavan, M.; Menin, S.; Bassani, D.; Sturlese, M.; Moro, S. Implementing a Scoring Function Based on Interaction Fingerprint for Autogrow4: Protein Kinase CK1Î´ as a Case Study. Front. Mol. Biosci. 2022, 9, 629.
